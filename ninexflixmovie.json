Far-fetched in writing but high on star power and style,&nbsp;<em>Pathaan</em>&nbsp;initially seems like a filmy Mountain Dew commercial which slowly but steadily finds its footing.<br /><br />The plot follows India&rsquo;s revocation of article 370 (special status of Jammu and Kashmir) and its impact on a Pakistani officer, who wants India to pay for this &lsquo;mistake&rsquo;. He reaches out to the formidable Jim, an Ex-RAW agent wronged by his own people. He is joined by his ravishing accomplice Rubai an ex-ISI agent (Deepika Padukone) with ambiguous motives. Pathaan, Jim and Rubai lock eyes and horns, as they hop continents and indulge in a dangerous game of betrayal and revenge. The three race to destroy and protect the worlds they believe in.</div>\n<h1><strong>Play Wath Movie</strong<br /><br />Director Siddharth Anand gives an over-the-top treatment to his spy thriller. He presents it more like a superhero film that needs massive suspension of disbelief. His fascination and fanboy worship of mainstream Hollywood blockbusters like Marvel films or Tom Cruise&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Mission Impossible</em>&nbsp;series to name a few, is evident here. Expect Falcon like wingsuit, exaggerated action &amp; chase sequences, death and gravity-defying stunts on cars, bikes, ice and helicopters, immortal heroes and villains mouthing punchy dialogues, a femme fatale and all of this seeped in the idea of patriotism.<br /><br />Action overrides emotions for major part of the film and that&rsquo;s new territory for SRK, who is most loved in romantic or conversational roles. It&rsquo;s interesting how he lets his body do the talking along with those powerfully evocative eyes at 57, as a full-fledged action hero. It is his presence that salvages an average script and subpar VFX. While the background score doesn&rsquo;t quite feel in sync with the scenarios, the film&rsquo;s music by Vishal &amp; Shekhar manages to reflect the heroism and bravado on display.<br /><br /><em>Pathaan&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;highlight is also John Abraham&rsquo;s solid portrayal of Jim. Be it his Bane like masked entry or stunt sequences, John is menacing and makes a classic case of the villain overshadowing the hero in portions.<br /><br />Deepika Padukone can kick ass and is perfectly cast as the dutiful, double crossing, morally ambiguous leggy agent but her chemistry with SRK feels underdeveloped. It lacks the spark that John-SRK&rsquo;s characters share. Dimple Kapadia does a Tenet once again and lends that much-needed gravitas and emotional heft to the proceedings. You wish other characters exuded the sincerity of her part.<br /><br />The YRF spy universe reunites Karan and Arjun (wink wink) to give you an iconic whistle moment as Bhai meets the badshah. If you are willing to overlook the frivolity in dialogues like &lsquo;You are pretty screwed&rsquo;,&nbsp;<em>Pathaan</em>&nbsp;has all the ingredients of a masala potboiler &mdash; slowmo entries, iconic battle of good versus bad and most importantly, a sexy-smouldering Shah Rukh Khan, who can fight the good fight on and off the screen. He&rsquo;s still the undisputed King.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

The film opens with a striking single-shot sequence depicting the aftermath of a train blast, setting the tone for a captivating experience. Viduthalai Part 1 centers around the conflict between the police department and an activist group striving to protect indigenous people and their resources.<br /><br />Soori plays Kumeresan, a police driver stationed in a sensitive hilly region where the conflict is most intense. As he becomes more acquainted with the area, he inadvertently saves the life of an indigenous woman, inviting the wrath of his superiors and exposing him to the brutality of the police unit stationed there. The department launches \"Ghost Hunt,\" an operation to capture Vaathiyaar (Vijay Sethupathi), the leader of the activist group, and impede their progress. While no one knows Vaathiyaar's whereabouts, Kumeresan claims to have certain leads on his location.<br /><br />As Kumeresan falls in love with one of the tribal women (Bhavani Sre), the police force begins exercising their authority over the people to capture Vaathiyaar. Caught in the crossfire, Kumeresan has no choice but to pursue Vaathiyaar to save numerous lives.<br /><br />Vetri Maaran, known for his compelling writing and staging, delivers another engrossing narrative with Viduthalai Part 1. From the opening moments, the film captivates the audience with tension and takes them on a journey of impactful conflicts. Though the events leading up to the conflicts are simple, Vetri Maaran's vision behind projecting them is exceptionally powerful, inducing an adrenaline rush in the audience.</div>\n<div>Play Movie Now<br /><br />The climactic scenes are masterfully executed action sequences that smoothly transition into Part 2. The brief glimpses of Part 2 provide a satisfying ending, leaving viewers eager to uncover the truth and politics behind the conflicts. While there are instances of police brutality, Vetri Maaran's portrayal is neutral, showcasing both sides of the issue. The cast is skillfully chosen, with Soori fitting into his role with ease and Vijay Sethupathi delivering a menacing performance as Vaathiyaar with minimal screen time.<br /><br />Ilaiyaraaja's background score is a standout feature, completely immersing viewers in the film's landscape and brutal events. Some sequences may be hard to watch due to their realistic portrayal of brutality. While there are occasional technical flaws, they are forgivable given the film's scale and the terrain it was shot in.<br /><br />Other actors, including Chethan, Rajiv Menon, and Gautham Menon, contribute well to the film's progression. Bhavani Sre delivers an intense performance in a few scenes, making them particularly memorable.<br /><br />At two and a half hours, Viduthalai Part 1 maintains a consistent pace and keeps viewers engaged with moments of high tension. It stays true to Vetri Maaran's style and artistry, making audiences eager for the sequel.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Who is he, and what made him such a monster?</em><br /><br /><strong>Bagheera Movie Review:</strong>&nbsp;In the very first scene of Adhik Ravichandran's Bagheera, as the credits roll, we see glimpses of YouTube shows in which young men rant about their ex-girlfriends and their failed love. This gives us an idea of how regressive the rest of the film is going to be. Bagheera, which was supposed to release a few years ago, is a badly written film that serves as a perfect example of how a psychological thriller should never be dealt with.<br /><br />Like every other crime thriller, the film kicks off with a scene in which a girl gets murdered in a gory way. A few minutes into the film, we witness a series of such murders happening in the city. The targeted girls are gifted with a huge teddy bear doll that kills them by injecting chemicals into their bodies. Later, we realise that Bagheera (Prabhudeva) is behind all of this, and he's a psychopath who's on a killing spree. There's even an app designed under the same name, in which youngsters can upload pictures of their girlfriends who are involved in multiple relationships, and Bagheera comes to their rescue.<br /><br />Bagheera is sort of an avenging angel for those men who are emotionally disturbed after being betrayed by women. Things take a turn when a psychology student, Ramya (Amyra Dastur), crosses his path. She gets caught alone with him at a private villa in Sri Lanka.<br /><br />Can Ramya escape from the hands of this psychopath or will she fall prey to him?<br /><br />Bagheera is the sort of film that makes us feel like it should never have been made at all. With adverse commentary on how a girl must behave and be, the sequences in the first half have the potential to instigate evilness among weak-minded people out there. Although the director tries to convince us by incorporating a few dialogues in the climax that are in stark contrast to the opinion that's been portrayed throughout, the core idea itself is flawed in many ways. The plot is weak and not powerful enough to keep the audience engaged for most parts.<br /><br />A good psychological thriller should force the viewers to dive into the minds of the psychopaths, however weird they may be, and then let us empathise with the characters. None of the sequences in Bagheera make us understand the plight of the main character or the motivation behind the killing spree. The flashback portions that appear in the second half, featuring Bagheera and his brother Murali (Srikanth), are neither intense nor emotional.<br /><br />The pre-climactic sequences are written more like a slasher thriller where a girl gets trapped in a villa with a psychopath. Again, it doesn't work, and the making looks very amateurish. Even with actors like Nasser, Prabhudeva, and Srikanth, the film struggles too hard to become a watchable affair. Also, dialogues like 'Ponnungalala dhaan pasanga paithiyakaarangala sutharanga' only add more to the misery. There are many female characters in the film, and most of them don't have much scope to perform except for Sakshi Agarwal and Amyra Dastur. Both have done a decent job and delivered what's expected of them.<br /><br />Prabhudeva surprises us with his antics, and he has delivered an intense performance. But then, none of it stays in our mind, as the world in which these acts are staged is not relatable at all. The technical aspects of the film, too, aren't captivating enough for a subject like this. Bagheera might have worked if it had been released decades ago, but even then, it's absurd to propagate these kinds of ideas.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

The film attempts to shed light on an important issue, but unfortunately falls short of delivering a truly impactful and engaging cinematic experience.<br /><br />The film follows Jeeva (Ishaaon), a Kabaddi player, who finds himself coming to the rescue of his girlfriend's friend, Jessie (Pranali Ghoghare), after she falls prey to the gang. As Jeeva tries to protect other girls and take down the gang, he is forced to confront the ruthless and feared Thuraipandi, portrayed with finesse by Daniel Balaji.</div>\n<br /><br />While the film does have some decent moments of conflict in the first half, the writing and execution is often clich&eacute;d, predictable, and formulaic. The cinematography is basic, failing to bring any additional emotional depth to the story. However, Pranali's portrayal of Jeeva's girlfriend adds some value to the film.<br /><br />Ariyavan may not be a complete failure, but it lacks the substance and creativity needed to truly make an impact. Despite its attempts to address important social issues, the film fails to offer anything particularly new or noteworthy. As a result, it remains an average film that ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression on its audience.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

      "link": "<h1>Dasara Movie Review : Nani delivers a memorable performance in this slow burn</h1>\n<div data-plugin=\"dynamiccontent\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Dasara Story:&nbsp;</strong>Dharani (Nani), Suri (Deekshith Shetty) and Vennela (Keerthy Suresh) are friends since childhood. Their relatively calm lives are upended for reasons far beyond their control and things will never be the same.<br /><br /><strong>Dasara Review:&nbsp;</strong>Debutant Srikanth Odela&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Dasara&nbsp;</em>is a mixed bag and there&rsquo;s no two ways about it. On one hand, the film is visually gripping, the characters seem like they&rsquo;ve more to offer and the atmosphere feels like everything is about to come undone at any second. On the other hand, Srikanth sets up themes he never fully explores, or worse, wraps them up with hasty conclusions. Due to that, the sucker punches hit you hard and the rest&hellip;they just don&rsquo;t.<br /><br />The setting is Veerlapally. Drinking at the Silk Bar (an ode to the owner&rsquo;s love for Silk Smitha) here isn&rsquo;t an addiction, it&rsquo;s tradition. Despite everyone pumping money into the bar, not everyone is allowed inside due to casteism running rampant. But the men don&rsquo;t seem to mind, much to the chagrin of the women in the village. Everyone seems covered at all times in a layer of soot due to the coal mining in the village. Rajanna (Sai Kumar), Shivanna (Samuthirakani) and the latter&rsquo;s son Chinna Nambi (Shine Tom Chacko) tussle for power, but the one in control of the liquor always wins.</div>\n</h1>\n<p><br />Dharani (Nani) fears a lot of things since childhood. He&rsquo;d rather not speak up in uncomfortable situations and as a child, he loses bladder control if he hears a cat shriek nearby. One day his grandma tells him that she drinks to keep fear at bay, to no one&rsquo;s surprise, Dharani is always found with bottles hanging off his waist at any given time. Suri (Deekshith Shetty) is his best friend and Dharani will do anything for him. Even if it means 'giving up' his love for Vennela (Keerthy Suresh), who also has eyes for only Suri.<br /><br />As much as Dharani and his tribe of underdogs want to steal coal off trains, drink themselves to an early death and be left alone in their tomfoolery, they&rsquo;re dragged into something bigger. An issue snowballs, hidden agendas revealed, body count racked up till Dharani will have to learn to face his fears without the help of his trusty friends &ndash; alcohol and Suri.<br /><br />Srikanth spends most of the first half of the film setting up the world of Veerlapally and the characters that reside in it. He spends ample time on the small moments. After something major upends everyone&rsquo;s lives, you expect Srikanth to go full throttle in the second half. Instead, he lets his characters sit with their emotions. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to scenes that keep you fully engaged. Some don&rsquo;t hold your attention, some are too heavy, and the much-hyped song&nbsp;<em>Chamkeela Angeelesi&nbsp;</em>just comes out of nowhere. He also doesn&rsquo;t dig deep enough into some of the topics he explores.<br /><br />However, when Srikanth delivers, he does it with full assuredness. Few scenes in&nbsp;<em>Dasara&nbsp;</em>stay with you long after the film is done. The pre-interval is chilling, it&rsquo;s not your usual &lsquo;interval bang,&rsquo; you really don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s going to go from here. The climax is cathartic and bloody, with the director going full throttle and refusing to hold back. The massy, elevation scenes work, so do the emotional ones for the most part. Women in this universe suffer due to the men&rsquo;s choices, but they also sometimes get their say.<br /><br />Nani gives his sweat, blood, and tears to playing Dharani. After&nbsp;<em>Jersey</em>, this is probably his heaviest film till date and he carries it on his shoulders. Keerthy Suresh excels in some scenes and not so much in others. She&rsquo;s a delight to watch when she&rsquo;s dancing at a&nbsp;<em>baraat&nbsp;</em>but you feel frustrated when she acts hammy in a key scene. Shine Tom Chacko gets the chance to be unhinged in a scene, but he feels wasted otherwise. The same holds true for Sai Kumar and Samuthirakani. Poorna and Deekshith play their parts well. Sathyan Sooryan&rsquo;s cinematography is a major plus for the film, so is Santhosh Narayanan&rsquo;s music.<br /><br /><em>Dasara&nbsp;</em>is not the film that leaves you with a smile at the end of it all, it also doesn&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel. Could it have been better? Sure. But Srikanth Odela and Nani make this slow burn work. So, credit where credit is due.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

But as his twisted journey unfolds, his surprising backstory adds a whole new dimension to his villainous deeds.</em><br /><br /><strong>Agilan Movie Review:&nbsp;</strong>Rarely do we get to explore unfamiliar worlds in Kollywood, but Jayam Ravi's Agilan, set in the Chennai port, captures the day-to-day goings in the place pretty well. What sets it apart is the believable world and the inclusion of massy elements, typical of any commercial entertainer.<br /><br />However, the film falls short in the second half, failing to match the expectations set in the first half. The film kicks off by acquainting us with the cargo operations at Chennai harbour and the group controlling the sea traffic and illegal businesses behind it. Agilan, played by Jayam Ravi, a ruthless crane operator, rises in rank to become the 'King of the Indian Ocean' after accomplishing a daring deal for Kapoor, a notorious kingpin. But is that enough for Agilan or is he on a personal mission?<br /><br />Director Kalyana Krishnan captures life at the port convincingly, with interesting sequences in the initial setup. Unfortunately, things start to fall apart when Agilan's personal story and intentions are introduced. The sequences that follow become predictable and reduce the intensity of the film, which was initially quite high. The film's main drawback is the timing of the plot points in the second half. For instance, Agilan could have remained a villain for a more extended period to keep the audience's attention. His motive to use ships for charity to solve world hunger issues is the political backdrop underlined in the film but is not impactful enough. The early introduction of the backstory spoils the pacing of the film.<br /><br />The dialogues are punchy and interesting, with Priya Bhavani Shankar's character, a cop who helps Agilan pursue his motives, delivering a credible performance. Although she doesn't have much scope to perform, her presence is notable. The other actors, including Harish Uttaman and Tanya Hope, have also given their best.<br /><br />Jayam Ravi's performance stands out as he single-handedly carries the film, having put in a lot of effort in his body language and dialogue delivery. His presence as a rugged crane operator elevates the average plot. Although Agilan has the usual commercial tropes we've seen before, its backdrop makes it slightly more interesting. While the film is watchable, the second half fails to satisfy the audience's expectations.<br /><br />The technical crew deserves credit for their efforts in shooting an entire film in a harbour. Sam CS's background score deserves a special mention as it complements the film well. The staging and shots also flow smoothly, without interrupting the film's narrative. The scale of the film is impressive, given its massive production, and the makers should be commended for pulling it off to an extent.<br /><br />Agilan could have been better, but it's worth a watch.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><br /><br /></p>"

The film attempts to shed light on an important issue, but unfortunately falls short of delivering a truly impactful and engaging cinematic experience.<br /><br />The film follows Jeeva (Ishaaon), a Kabaddi player, who finds himself coming to the rescue of his girlfriend's friend, Jessie (Pranali Ghoghare), after she falls prey to the gang. As Jeeva tries to protect other girls and take down the gang, he is forced to confront the ruthless and feared Thuraipandi, portrayed with finesse by Daniel Balaji.<br /><br />While the film does have some decent moments of conflict in the first half, the writing and execution is often clich&eacute;d, predictable, and formulaic. The cinematography is basic, failing to bring any additional emotional depth to the story. However, Pranali's portrayal of Jeeva's girlfriend adds some value to the film.<br /><br />Ariyavan may not be a complete failure, but it lacks the substance and creativity needed to truly make an impact. Despite its attempts to address important social issues, the film fails to offer anything particularly new or noteworthy. As a result, it remains an average film that ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression on its audience.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Obviously, it has seeped into pop culture as one of the most potent backdrops for any contemporary story to play out against. How many times since 2020 have we seen a movie&rsquo;s plot center around the pandemic? I am not complaining, but I also cannot deny that it is starting to become a little monotonous now, especially if these movies don&rsquo;t have anything new to offer. The Malayalam thriller (?), Alone (2023), directed by Shaji Kailas, is a perfect example of the same.</aside>\n<div>\n<div data-first=\"A\">\n<p>&nbsp;It is 2020, and the opening credits help us reel back to the days when death and suffering had shadowed the whole nation. News reports boom in the background as the camera follows one colorful vehicle traveling along empty roads and highways to reach its destination, Strawberry Heights in Kochi. Kalidasan (played by Mohanlal) steps out of the car in style, introduced to the audience as a mask-wearing hero in vibrant clothes and a shower of sanitizer spray.</p>\n<p>He drove from Coimbatore to Kochi in less than 4 hours and has come to live alone in a rented apartment on the 13th floor. The apartment is fully furnished and reeks of a gorgeous place for living in peace and safety while millions across the country suffer. However, from the first night at this place, strange things start happening &ndash; his burger is thrown inside a waste bin, and he sees a book flip itself under his bed. Kalidasan thinks that he may have caught Covid and is hallucinating, but is told off both by Yasodha and his doctor. Is Kalidasan delusional, or are there supernatural entities present around him in this apartment? Kailas&rsquo; film is not only bizarre but extremely boring with every ticking second. If you make it to the climax, I won&rsquo;t be astonished if you just eye-roll yourself to death at it.</p>\n<p>The camera somersaults around Mohanlal, giving him more attention than he deserves. In the process, it fails to capture the realistic elements of the apartment and its surroundings. Accompanied by weird camera angles, the background score is so loud you&rsquo;d like to turn the volume down right from the start of the movie. Both these elements desperately try to frame the horror for us because the script just isn&rsquo;t doing it. The dialogue writing, too, is far from being promising. The jokes don&rsquo;t land; it doesn&rsquo;t help that Mohanlal is the one delivering these jokes on most occasions. For example, in one scene where he listens to the sound of cracking bones, he only comes up with a reply as bland as &ldquo;good job.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-scaled.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:690x388/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-scaled.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1920w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-768x432.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 768w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-1536x864.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1536w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-2048x1152.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 2048w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-450x253.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 450w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-20x11.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 20w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-225x127.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 225w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-900x506.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 900w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-1350x759.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1350w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-150x84.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 150w\" alt=\"Alone (2023) Review\" width=\"393\" height=\"221\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-scaled.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1920w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-768x432.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 768w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-1536x864.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1536w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-2048x1152.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 2048w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-450x253.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 450w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-20x11.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 20w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-225x127.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 225w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-900x506.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 900w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-1350x759.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 1350w,https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-150x84.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1 150w\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.highonfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alone-2023-Review-scaled.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:690x388/rscb1/ng:webp/ngcb1\" /></figure>\n<p>Mohanlal is alone in this film (the joke in the preceding line is just as bad as the movie-watching experience). Because he is the only one we get to look at on the screen, he presents himself in many avatars, from a sneaker and t-shirt-wearing hero whose silver-grey suitcase rolls by itself to a white kurta-pajama wearing man who is focused on practicing yoga to keep himself mindful and calm. He performs like he always does, with an amusing screen presence to keep you entertained, but it isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>\n<p>The last time someone had to spend time alone in an apartment accidentally was&nbsp;Rajkumar Rao as Shaurya in Trapped&nbsp;(2016), a Bollywood film directed by Vikramaditya Motwane. It has to be one of the best performances in recent Indian cinema that reek of horror and fear. Sharing a similar vibe in spirit, Mohanlal fumbles to deliver anything close to the best.</p>\n<p>In one scene, when Kalidasan is sharing some payasam with his neighbor, the film sweeps into slow motion. Why? I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure it out yet. In fact, I am mildly terrified that someone even thought of this plot as being good enough to make a movie on. If you are willing to let sacrifice around 2 hours of your time watching Mohanlal try to sell a sub-par film to his loving audience, Alone (2023) is currently streaming on Disney+Hostar.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

What follows is a series of incidents that transform the life of one of the family members.</em><br /><br /><strong>Ayothi Movie Review:</strong>&nbsp;Movies that touch on human values and emotions never fail to captivate us. And when a film is effective enough to immerse us in its world, we expect nothing less than a good movie. Ayothi, directed by Mandhira Moorthy, is the kind of film that leaves a lasting impression on its viewers despite a melodramatic approach. It addresses various issues such as religion, superstitions, chauvinistic attitudes of men, and more.<br /><br />The director has skillfully kept the plot simple without introducing too many characters, events, or subplots, despite touching on so many issues. Within a few minutes into the film, we are introduced to a family of four from Ayothi. The family is headed by a conservative, religious patriarch, Yashpal Sharma, who treats his wife cruelly and exploits her in many ways. They have two children &mdash; a college-going girl, Shivani, played by Preethi Asrani, and a young boy. On the occasion of Deepavali, the family decides to go on a spiritual trip to Rameswaram, not knowing that the trip would turn into a disaster. Janki, the mother of the two children, suffers serious injuries in an accident, and a man from Rameshwaram, Sasikumar, who happens to be the friend of the cab driver involved, decides to help the helpless family.<br /><br />Things get complicated when Janki dies on the way to the government hospital. The rest of the story depicts the sufferings of the two children at the hands of their extremely religious father and how Sasikumar and his friend, Pugazh, help them to take their mother's dead body to their hometown despite all odds.<br /><br />Debutant director Mandhira Moorthy's craft is powerful enough to hold the audience's attention throughout the film. The characters and dialogue are well-etched and kept as real as possible. Mandhira Moorthy has sensibly understood what a protagonist should be. Sasikumar's heroism is subtle, and his character beautifully travels along with the story.<br /><br />When a filmmaker introduces us to a character in the very first scene with evil attributes, it's obvious that they will undergo a transformation in the end. But how it happens matters the most, and Mandhira Moorthy has presented it with many heartwarming moments. Although the script lacks major conflicts, it makes up for it with deeper emotions that resonate with the audience. The audience travels along with the emotions of a family from North India, which is a rare occurrence in Tamil cinema. Preethi Asrani's performance as Shivani is exceptional, and the director has rightly used close-up shots to highlight her acting skills.<br /><br />It's refreshing to see Pugazh in a character role instead of a comedian. He has done justice to the role given to him. Yashpal Sharma's performance as a man with conservative and chauvinistic attitudes is convincing, and his act towards the climax is commendable. Sasikumar has played his role well and fits in perfectly. Revealing his character name might spoil the experience of the viewers, so it's best not to reveal it.<br /><br />Composer NT Raghunanthan's background score elevates the emotional sequences to another level, helping the viewers connect with the characters on screen many times. The other technical aspects are decent enough to hold the audience. Madhesh Manickam's cinematography captures the emotions effectively and lets his frame speak for itself. The quality is evident right from the very first scene and the locales of Ayodhya and Rameswaram are captured beautifully.<br /><br />Ayothi is a movie that constantly emphasises love over religion, and it's worth watching.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Both doomed.<br /><strong><br />Review:&nbsp;</strong>Amrita (Alaya F.) is a charming and bubbly schoolgirl, whose life revolves around watching movies by secretly taking DVDs from a local shop owner&rsquo;s son Yaqub (Karan Mehta), making funny Ting Tong videos under a disguise and tuning in to DJ Mohabbat&rsquo;s podcasts. She adores the DJ and her only mission in life is to attend his hotshot Holi party at a secret location in the hills. But before she could make plans, her conservative Hindu family puts her under house arrest for spending time with the neighbourhood Muslim boy, who in their opinion, &ldquo;pehle mohabbat dikhate hain, phir Jannat.&rdquo; Blinded by their passion for DJ Mohabbat&rsquo;s music, the two youngsters elope from home, setting off a chain of events that are sure to not end well. In a parallel world, Yaqub&rsquo;s lookalike Harmeet (Karan Mehta) is trying hard to make his mark as a budding musician, but just then Ayesha (Alaya F.), a rich spoilt daughter of a London-based Pakistani businessman starts crushing and obsessing over him, to a point that her actions start affecting his life adversely. Strangely, she is the exact lookalike of Amrita but none of them are related.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s an interesting concept and oftentimes there are moments of thrill and unpredictability when you don&rsquo;t know what is going to happen. Anurag Kashyap&rsquo;s story is layered too, but never comes together in a cohesive manner. Instead, it seems like it&rsquo;s trying to tackle too many issues without much conviction. From love jihad to same sex marriages and patriarchal, dysfunctional families to differences due to caste, religion and social inequality - it&rsquo;s all there but none explored and executed in a way that it leaves a lasting impact on your mind. The film constantly switches between the dimly lit streets and pubs of London and the snowed out mountainous terrains of Himachal. Amit Trivedi&rsquo;s unconventional music and Shellee&rsquo;s funky lyrics (like &lsquo;<em>Mohabbat se Kranti</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>Ghanghor Connection</em>&rsquo;) feel young, fresh and relevant to the story, but for a musical, the overall score isn&rsquo;t up to the mark. We doubt if you will retain any of the many songs, after you leave the theatre.<br /><br />Vicky Kaushal as DJ Mohabbat is interesting and the actor seems to be enjoying the quirks of his character, which he reprises from his 2018 film &lsquo;Manmarziyan&rsquo;. Newcomer Karan Mehta is confident onscreen and shows promise. At times, he does go overboard as Harmeet and his fake laughter act is downright annoying. Alaya F., as always, does a fine job of breathing life into her role and the actor is equally good in her glam and de-glam avatars. From a rebellious, small town schoolgirl, who goes against her male-dominated family to a brash and hopelessly-in-love Londoner &ndash; Alaya is brilliant in both her roles.<br /><br />Overall, it&rsquo;s a love story fraught with regular societal challenges and clich&eacute;s, told in a unique way. But beyond that it falls woefully short of making this film an entertaining and a deeply engaging experience. Like Alaya&rsquo;s character Amrita tells Yaqub after their long and arduous journey, &ldquo;Na koi plan hai, na purpose&rdquo; &ndash; well, our thought precisely.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Eerie surroundings, creepy paintings, an old, rustic haveli, dark screen tone, an alleged murder, and the main hotel staff who looks neat but gives&nbsp;<em>andar se haivaan</em>&nbsp;feels &ndash; Gaslight checks all the boxes required for a thriller to work. On top of that, you have an odd combo of a Sara Ali Khan, a Chitrangda Singh and a Vikrant Massey, unravelling mysteries in a&nbsp;<em>haveli</em>. But is there one at all? Read our review of Disney+ Hotstar&rsquo;s latest release Gaslight, and you&rsquo;ll know (somewhat).</p>\n<p>While we will get into the bit on whether the film title, Gaslight, suffices the plot, here&rsquo;s a little background. Sara Ali Khan (Meesha) is a young paraplegic woman confined to a wheelchair, who returns to her family&rsquo;s royal palace 15 years after receiving a letter from her father, Raja Ratan Singh Gaikwad. However, she returns to be greeted by her suspicious-looking stepmother Rukmini (played by Chitrangda Singh), only to learn that he&rsquo;s away on a business trip. But is he?</p>\n<p>The estate is still the same and is looked after by Kapil (Vikrant Massey), who is &lsquo;<em>kareeb hokey bhi neeji zindagi se koso durr&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;from his employer, Raja Saheb. And that is where your suspicion grows. A too-good-to-be-true character in a thriller draws suspicion and that&rsquo;s where you secretly pray that the makers do a good job by not plotting the obvious. Spoiler alert, but that&rsquo;s one of the few areas of disappointment in the film that we&rsquo;d like to term &lsquo;loophole&rsquo;.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Going by the tempo and the horror movie feels that Gaslight tries to draw in the beginning, the film will remind you of Alfred Hitchcock&rsquo;s Pyscho in a modern world. A paraplegic woman having the guts to explore a creepy-looking mysterious palace when it's all dark and raining outside, is something that we often justify by saying, &lsquo;<em>sirf filmon mein hota hain</em>&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Devoid of songs, Gaslight, as the name suggests, does make certain characters question their sanity using psychological means. For instance, when Meesha follows the shadow of her father, Daata (apparently), you will fear the unknown. So a thumbs-up on suspense creation. However, no thriller can survive without the use of background tracks. Gaslight did a good job with that. Be it the self-playing piano scene or the creaking of the old floorboard every time Meesha dragged her wheelchair to unravel a mystery - full marks to the sound editor on that.</p>\n<p>Talking about owning the characters and acting, Sara Ali Khan indeed worked on her accent and acting. Though she has a long way to go, her expressions and dialogue delivery didn&rsquo;t look forced, unlike her last few films. Chitrangada Singh is only ageing like fine wine and the film couldn&rsquo;t have had a better Rukmini than her. She successfully carried all the suspicion of the character until;&nbsp;<em>chalo choro</em>!</p>\n<div>&nbsp;Vikrant Massey is known as a performer and has paved his way to the top because of his acting prowess and hard work. He yet again proved his mettle through his film. Though he isn&rsquo;t the only one to have layers to his character, his transition is so smooth that you&rsquo;ll barely notice, in spite of expecting it from the very start.</div>\n<p>Director Pavan Kirpalani is best known for mastering the psycho-thriller genre. Gaslight might not be counted as one of his best works, however, we have to give him bonus points for trying to pull off a difficult genre as this one.</p>\n<p>The film may visually have all the necessary elements required for a thriller, but it did lag in bits when it came to the screenplay. For instance, when one of the biggest mysteries in the film gets solved, the audience is intrigued to know the whys and the hows. That needed some meat. We also needed the character development between Kapil and his love angle in the film. We know time is a constraint but it happens too fast and the audience is left questioning &ndash; &lsquo;<em>Hua toh hua kaise</em>?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>But one of the best bits about Gaslight is the&nbsp;<em>twist pe twist&nbsp;</em>in the end. The film blooms in the last 15 minutes and we are not complaining because that is where all the unravelling happens in thrillers. Extra marks for ensuring that the script doesn&rsquo;t end as we apprehended.</p>\n<p>All in all, Gaslight is a rather refreshing cooler in the sea of psycho thrillers. It definitely deserves a watch.</p>"

Krishna</p>\n<p>Country: India</p>\n<p>Release: 2023-03-30<br />Pathu Thala (2023): An undercover cop goes into the big bad world, a place taken over by a don, where his safety may be compromised</p>\n<h1>Pathu Thala Movie Review : STR and Gautham Karthik elevate this fairly-engaging gangster film</h1>\n<div data-plugin=\"dynamiccontent\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><br /><strong>Pathu Thala Movie Review:&nbsp;</strong>South Indian film industries have no shortage of movies that depict the rivalry between a daring cop and a feared gangster. However, what truly makes a film stand out in this genre are the events and incidents that unfold, bringing the audience closer to the characters' world. Pathu Thala, the official Tamil remake of the hit Kannada film Mufti, has some memorable moments, however, the film's attempt to constantly engage the audience sometimes comes across as forced.<br /><br />The story follows Shakthivel (Gautham Karthik), an undercover cop, as he investigates the disappearance of the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu (Santhosh Pratap). He believes that a feared gangster, AGR (Silambarasan TR), is responsible. However, AGR's stronghold in the sand-mining business makes it difficult for Shakthivel to gather evidence against him. As Shakthivel works to gain AGR's trust, he uncovers shocking revelations that shake his resolve.<br /><br />Similar to the original film, STR appears predominantly in the second half of Pathu Thala. However, this is where the narrative becomes tighter and more engaging. The initial sequences where Shakthivel learns about AGR's influence and power fall short, lacking the impact that would hook the audience. But the soul of the film lies in the post-interval sequences, with STR delivering a standout performance.<br /><br />While the trope of a gangster as a do-gooder for the people around him and a criminal in the eyes of the government is nothing new, the staging and drama in the second half of the film make it more engaging. Pathu Thala incorporates elements of betrayal and gory violence, as is typical of gangster flicks, but fails to create a lasting impact or a strong connection with the central characters.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, the film is a fairly entertaining gangster flick that will mostly satisfy STR fans. The climactic fight sequence is accompanied by an effective background score by AR Rahman, which strikes a chord with the audience and elevates its impact. However, the film could have done without a song featuring Simbu in the second half, as it adds little value to the story. Priya Bhavani Shankar delivers a decent performance as the district collector, but her flashback portions with Gautham Karthik could have been more impactful.<br /><br />The intense performances of Silambarasan and Gautham Karthik make us overlook some of the logical mistakes made by the writer. Gautham, in particular, manages to look authentic as an undercover cop. Gautham Vasudev Menon's performance as the Deputy Chief Minister is commendable, and the technical aspects of the film are quite efficient, with only a couple of shots falling out of focus.<br /><br />Overall, Pathu Thala may not be a great film for those who have watched the original, but it's still worth watching for the lead actors and some standout moments.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

But three major storylines at the end of Season 4 centered on Anna (Erin Karpluk) getting arrested for her role in Peter&rsquo;s (Andrew Leeds) death, Maggie getting pregnant, and Rome (Romany Malco) and Regina (Christina Moses) accidentally learning that Gary is battling cancer again.</p>\n<p>The official episode description is as follows: &ldquo;The family of friends gathers once again to celebrate the life of a loved one who dies unexpectedly.

It&rsquo;s a hopeful celebration of found family and a reminder that life ebbs and flows, so other family-centric dramas that extract extraordinary meaning from everyday moments &mdash; like&nbsp;This Is Us,&nbsp;Parenthood,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Friday Night Lights&nbsp;&mdash; come to mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Take:</strong>&nbsp;Before&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things&nbsp;</em>drops its title card in the Season 5 premiere, you&rsquo;ll be wiping tears from your eyes and feeling as though you just reunited with a long-lost friend. Without spoiling the series&rsquo; highly-anticipated return, &ldquo;The Last Dance&rdquo; maximizes the storytelling potential of the show&rsquo;s final 13 episodes by succinctly addressing Season 4 cliffhangers and swiftly laying groundwork for future plot points.</p>\n<p>In true&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things</em>&nbsp;fashion, the premiere finds characters overflowing with formative memories, sparked by anything from a stick of deodorant to a box of Good &amp; Plenty. Several head-scratching moments pop up throughout the hour &mdash; including a major plot twist and an early line from Eddie that made me cringe so hard I questioned his entire personality. But as usual, the series&rsquo; lovable characters, aspirational connections, and relatable struggles help quell your doubts. Five seasons in, the cast&rsquo;s chemistry has never been stronger, nor has character growth ever been so apparent. James Roday Rodriguez continues to effortlessly tap into the duality of Gary Mendez, and the premiere&rsquo;s fluctuating tone and moving monologues tease marvelously multi-faceted performances to come.</p>\n<figure><img sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024 1024w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1284 1284w\" alt=\"LIZZY GREENE SORTING WHITE AND PINK GOOD &amp; PLENTY CANDY ON 'A MILLION LITTLE THINGS'\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-srcset=\"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024 1024w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1284 1284w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\n<figcaption data-gramm=\"false\">Photo: ABC/Sergei Bachlakov</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Through life events as monumental as a funeral or as inconsequential as a trip to the store, the drama continues to convey the importance of showing up for one other, being open to humor in times of grief, and remembering that tomorrow is unpromised. From&nbsp;abortion&nbsp;and racism to mental health, LGBTQ+ stories, addiction, and more, the series has never shied away from addressing serious topics in a prime-time ABC slot, and the premiere offers touching reassurance that same candor will continue to the end.</p>\n<p>As is often the case with shows that strike a balance between remarkably human and deliciously cheesy storytelling, the beginning of&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things</em>&lsquo; end will leave you feeling reinvigorated, raring to reclaim your time, and hungry for heart-to-hearts. Faithful viewers know that Gary and friends have &mdash; let&rsquo;s not sugarcoat it &mdash; been through&nbsp;<em>a lot of shit&nbsp;</em>since 2018. The series has always captured the confusing reality that life is beautiful and relentless. The highs demand to be celebrated, in part, because the lows never let up. But the lows aren&rsquo;t as bad if you have a solid support system behind you, and these tight-knit Bruins fans and their families are solid as they come. A mix of new beginnings and challenges are foreshadowed at the start of Season 5, but here&rsquo;s hoping that this group can finally catch one single collective break when the end credits roll on the series finale.</p>\n<p><strong>Sex and Skin:&nbsp;</strong>Aside from a few smooches,&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things</em>&nbsp;keeps its farewell season premiere clean. The only stripping down these characters do at the start of Season 5 is internal, because in true&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things&nbsp;</em>fashion, everyone is bravely baring their emotions.</p>\n<p><strong>Parting Shot:&nbsp;</strong>The episode highlights moments of pain and loss, but the parting shot captures the show&rsquo;s fictional friend group-turned-family celebrating a rare moment of unbridled joy. It&rsquo;s about time!</p>\n<p><strong>Sleeper Star:&nbsp;</strong>We got a taste of the full spectrum of emotions James Roday Rodriguez and Allison Miller will cycle through before saying goodbye to Gary and Maggie. But two unexpected season premiere standouts were Lou Beatty Jr. as Rome&rsquo;s dad Walter Howard, and his girlfriend Florence, played by Karen Robinson.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Pilot-y Line:</strong>&nbsp;Towards the end of the episode a character says, &ldquo;Sorry about bringing an entourage&hellip;it&rsquo;s just that our friend group, we&rsquo;re very invested in each other&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo; A real&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things&nbsp;</em>evergreen statement.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Call:&nbsp;</strong>STREAM IT. If you&rsquo;ve been following this friend group for four seasons, then you, too, are very invested in their lives.&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things</em>&nbsp;stays true to itself in the Season 5 premiere, so if you enjoyed the ride so far and want to see where these characters&rsquo; stories end, streaming the season is a no-brainer.</p>"
