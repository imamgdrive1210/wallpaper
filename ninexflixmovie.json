Far-fetched in writing but high on star power and style,&nbsp;<em>Pathaan</em>&nbsp;initially seems like a filmy Mountain Dew commercial which slowly but steadily finds its footing.<br /><br />The plot follows India&rsquo;s revocation of article 370 (special status of Jammu and Kashmir) and its impact on a Pakistani officer, who wants India to pay for this &lsquo;mistake&rsquo;. He reaches out to the formidable Jim, an Ex-RAW agent wronged by his own people. He is joined by his ravishing accomplice Rubai an ex-ISI agent (Deepika Padukone) with ambiguous motives. Pathaan, Jim and Rubai lock eyes and horns, as they hop continents and indulge in a dangerous game of betrayal and revenge. The three race to destroy and protect the worlds they believe in.</div>\n<h1><strong>Play Wath Movie</strong></h1>\n<p><video controls=\"controls\" width=\"350\" height=\"175\">\n<source src=\"https://ww2.1madrasrockers.team/files/Tamil%20Movies/Tamil%202023%20Movies/Pathaan%20(2023)%20Tamil%20Original%20HDRip/Pathaan%20Tamil%20Original%20HDRip%20Single%20Part/Pathaan%20(2023)%20Tamil%20Original%20HDRip%20Single%20Part.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /></video><br /><br />Director Siddharth Anand gives an over-the-top treatment to his spy thriller. He presents it more like a superhero film that needs massive suspension of disbelief. His fascination and fanboy worship of mainstream Hollywood blockbusters like Marvel films or Tom Cruise&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Mission Impossible</em>&nbsp;series to name a few, is evident here. Expect Falcon like wingsuit, exaggerated action &amp; chase sequences, death and gravity-defying stunts on cars, bikes, ice and helicopters, immortal heroes and villains mouthing punchy dialogues, a femme fatale and all of this seeped in the idea of patriotism.<br /><br />Action overrides emotions for major part of the film and that&rsquo;s new territory for SRK, who is most loved in romantic or conversational roles. It&rsquo;s interesting how he lets his body do the talking along with those powerfully evocative eyes at 57, as a full-fledged action hero. It is his presence that salvages an average script and subpar VFX. While the background score doesn&rsquo;t quite feel in sync with the scenarios, the film&rsquo;s music by Vishal &amp; Shekhar manages to reflect the heroism and bravado on display.<br /><br /><em>Pathaan&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;highlight is also John Abraham&rsquo;s solid portrayal of Jim. Be it his Bane like masked entry or stunt sequences, John is menacing and makes a classic case of the villain overshadowing the hero in portions.<br /><br />Deepika Padukone can kick ass and is perfectly cast as the dutiful, double crossing, morally ambiguous leggy agent but her chemistry with SRK feels underdeveloped. It lacks the spark that John-SRK&rsquo;s characters share. Dimple Kapadia does a Tenet once again and lends that much-needed gravitas and emotional heft to the proceedings. You wish other characters exuded the sincerity of her part.<br /><br />The YRF spy universe reunites Karan and Arjun (wink wink) to give you an iconic whistle moment as Bhai meets the badshah. If you are willing to overlook the frivolity in dialogues like &lsquo;You are pretty screwed&rsquo;,&nbsp;<em>Pathaan</em>&nbsp;has all the ingredients of a masala potboiler &mdash; slowmo entries, iconic battle of good versus bad and most importantly, a sexy-smouldering Shah Rukh Khan, who can fight the good fight on and off the screen. He&rsquo;s still the undisputed King.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Both doomed.<br /><strong><br />Review:&nbsp;</strong>Amrita (Alaya F.) is a charming and bubbly schoolgirl, whose life revolves around watching movies by secretly taking DVDs from a local shop owner&rsquo;s son Yaqub (Karan Mehta), making funny Ting Tong videos under a disguise and tuning in to DJ Mohabbat&rsquo;s podcasts. She adores the DJ and her only mission in life is to attend his hotshot Holi party at a secret location in the hills. But before she could make plans, her conservative Hindu family puts her under house arrest for spending time with the neighbourhood Muslim boy, who in their opinion, &ldquo;pehle mohabbat dikhate hain, phir Jannat.&rdquo; Blinded by their passion for DJ Mohabbat&rsquo;s music, the two youngsters elope from home, setting off a chain of events that are sure to not end well. In a parallel world, Yaqub&rsquo;s lookalike Harmeet (Karan Mehta) is trying hard to make his mark as a budding musician, but just then Ayesha (Alaya F.), a rich spoilt daughter of a London-based Pakistani businessman starts crushing and obsessing over him, to a point that her actions start affecting his life adversely. Strangely, she is the exact lookalike of Amrita but none of them are related.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s an interesting concept and oftentimes there are moments of thrill and unpredictability when you don&rsquo;t know what is going to happen. Anurag Kashyap&rsquo;s story is layered too, but never comes together in a cohesive manner. Instead, it seems like it&rsquo;s trying to tackle too many issues without much conviction. From love jihad to same sex marriages and patriarchal, dysfunctional families to differences due to caste, religion and social inequality - it&rsquo;s all there but none explored and executed in a way that it leaves a lasting impact on your mind. The film constantly switches between the dimly lit streets and pubs of London and the snowed out mountainous terrains of Himachal. Amit Trivedi&rsquo;s unconventional music and Shellee&rsquo;s funky lyrics (like &lsquo;<em>Mohabbat se Kranti</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>Ghanghor Connection</em>&rsquo;) feel young, fresh and relevant to the story, but for a musical, the overall score isn&rsquo;t up to the mark. We doubt if you will retain any of the many songs, after you leave the theatre.<br /><br />Vicky Kaushal as DJ Mohabbat is interesting and the actor seems to be enjoying the quirks of his character, which he reprises from his 2018 film &lsquo;Manmarziyan&rsquo;. Newcomer Karan Mehta is confident onscreen and shows promise. At times, he does go overboard as Harmeet and his fake laughter act is downright annoying. Alaya F., as always, does a fine job of breathing life into her role and the actor is equally good in her glam and de-glam avatars. From a rebellious, small town schoolgirl, who goes against her male-dominated family to a brash and hopelessly-in-love Londoner &ndash; Alaya is brilliant in both her roles.<br /><br />Overall, it&rsquo;s a love story fraught with regular societal challenges and clich&eacute;s, told in a unique way. But beyond that it falls woefully short of making this film an entertaining and a deeply engaging experience. Like Alaya&rsquo;s character Amrita tells Yaqub after their long and arduous journey, &ldquo;Na koi plan hai, na purpose&rdquo; &ndash; well, our thought precisely.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Eerie surroundings, creepy paintings, an old, rustic haveli, dark screen tone, an alleged murder, and the main hotel staff who looks neat but gives&nbsp;<em>andar se haivaan</em>&nbsp;feels &ndash; Gaslight checks all the boxes required for a thriller to work. On top of that, you have an odd combo of a Sara Ali Khan, a Chitrangda Singh and a Vikrant Massey, unravelling mysteries in a&nbsp;<em>haveli</em>. But is there one at all? Read our review of Disney+ Hotstar&rsquo;s latest release Gaslight, and you&rsquo;ll know (somewhat).</p>\n<p>While we will get into the bit on whether the film title, Gaslight, suffices the plot, here&rsquo;s a little background. Sara Ali Khan (Meesha) is a young paraplegic woman confined to a wheelchair, who returns to her family&rsquo;s royal palace 15 years after receiving a letter from her father, Raja Ratan Singh Gaikwad. However, she returns to be greeted by her suspicious-looking stepmother Rukmini (played by Chitrangda Singh), only to learn that he&rsquo;s away on a business trip. But is he?</p>\n<p>The estate is still the same and is looked after by Kapil (Vikrant Massey), who is &lsquo;<em>kareeb hokey bhi neeji zindagi se koso durr&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;from his employer, Raja Saheb. And that is where your suspicion grows. A too-good-to-be-true character in a thriller draws suspicion and that&rsquo;s where you secretly pray that the makers do a good job by not plotting the obvious. Spoiler alert, but that&rsquo;s one of the few areas of disappointment in the film that we&rsquo;d like to term &lsquo;loophole&rsquo;.</p>\n<p><video controls=\"controls\" width=\"350\" height=\"175\">\n<source src=\"https://867337140.tapecontent.net/radosgw/zMD8yGpK74Cgk7/iy8eeJiQ7PyfsKInwz2EWEZoVorR-IJQt4Ip81DEPogMWe1ldPa0140zlokZr1xqHS8--ODGwtcFasetTX0z6GdrPF5a6qy-v_bBK1Fi7eJawO-PgBE3kOTxjBFgPmQ4LZF7Evrvqf0V-Kpcv147IjlQ1wWRFmUN9RjeyUJAiSnQOIqCXBrAYN1g4BuVX2wZYuBxc9ZZO7xDujIUZYTsV1yh-xB29koWaWgU9Qb_C5TVIgkSM0WInAFNz8WvdCffk_lCB3e2gpPOUMc2XEKX3xZZMJIkqM4tWNTqudvcb6Z7DKhBUd2H-6-HEZA/Gaslight+%282023%29+Hindi+HD+720p.mp4?stream=1\" /></video></p>\n<p>Going by the tempo and the horror movie feels that Gaslight tries to draw in the beginning, the film will remind you of Alfred Hitchcock&rsquo;s Pyscho in a modern world. A paraplegic woman having the guts to explore a creepy-looking mysterious palace when it's all dark and raining outside, is something that we often justify by saying, &lsquo;<em>sirf filmon mein hota hain</em>&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Devoid of songs, Gaslight, as the name suggests, does make certain characters question their sanity using psychological means. For instance, when Meesha follows the shadow of her father, Daata (apparently), you will fear the unknown. So a thumbs-up on suspense creation. However, no thriller can survive without the use of background tracks. Gaslight did a good job with that. Be it the self-playing piano scene or the creaking of the old floorboard every time Meesha dragged her wheelchair to unravel a mystery - full marks to the sound editor on that.</p>\n<p>Talking about owning the characters and acting, Sara Ali Khan indeed worked on her accent and acting. Though she has a long way to go, her expressions and dialogue delivery didn&rsquo;t look forced, unlike her last few films. Chitrangada Singh is only ageing like fine wine and the film couldn&rsquo;t have had a better Rukmini than her. She successfully carried all the suspicion of the character until;&nbsp;<em>chalo choro</em>!</p>\n<div>&nbsp;Vikrant Massey is known as a performer and has paved his way to the top because of his acting prowess and hard work. He yet again proved his mettle through his film. Though he isn&rsquo;t the only one to have layers to his character, his transition is so smooth that you&rsquo;ll barely notice, in spite of expecting it from the very start.</div>\n<p>Director Pavan Kirpalani is best known for mastering the psycho-thriller genre. Gaslight might not be counted as one of his best works, however, we have to give him bonus points for trying to pull off a difficult genre as this one.</p>\n<p>The film may visually have all the necessary elements required for a thriller, but it did lag in bits when it came to the screenplay. For instance, when one of the biggest mysteries in the film gets solved, the audience is intrigued to know the whys and the hows. That needed some meat. We also needed the character development between Kapil and his love angle in the film. We know time is a constraint but it happens too fast and the audience is left questioning &ndash; &lsquo;<em>Hua toh hua kaise</em>?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>But one of the best bits about Gaslight is the&nbsp;<em>twist pe twist&nbsp;</em>in the end. The film blooms in the last 15 minutes and we are not complaining because that is where all the unravelling happens in thrillers. Extra marks for ensuring that the script doesn&rsquo;t end as we apprehended.</p>\n<p>All in all, Gaslight is a rather refreshing cooler in the sea of psycho thrillers. It definitely deserves a watch.</p>"

However, what truly makes a film stand out in this genre are the events and incidents that unfold, bringing the audience closer to the characters' world. Pathu Thala, the official Tamil remake of the hit Kannada film Mufti, has some memorable moments, however, the film's attempt to constantly engage the audience sometimes comes across as forced.<br /><br />The story follows Shakthivel (Gautham Karthik), an undercover cop, as he investigates the disappearance of the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu (Santhosh Pratap). He believes that a feared gangster, AGR (Silambarasan TR), is responsible. However, AGR's stronghold in the sand-mining business makes it difficult for Shakthivel to gather evidence against him. As Shakthivel works to gain AGR's trust, he uncovers shocking revelations that shake his resolve.<br /><br />Similar to the original film, STR appears predominantly in the second half of Pathu Thala. However, this is where the narrative becomes tighter and more engaging. The initial sequences where Shakthivel learns about AGR's influence and power fall short, lacking the impact that would hook the audience. But the soul of the film lies in the post-interval sequences, with STR delivering a standout performance.<br /><br />While the trope of a gangster as a do-gooder for the people around him and a criminal in the eyes of the government is nothing new, the staging and drama in the second half of the film make it more engaging. Pathu Thala incorporates elements of betrayal and gory violence, as is typical of gangster flicks, but fails to create a lasting impact or a strong connection with the central characters.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, the film is a fairly entertaining gangster flick that will mostly satisfy STR fans. The climactic fight sequence is accompanied by an effective background score by AR Rahman, which strikes a chord with the audience and elevates its impact. However, the film could have done without a song featuring Simbu in the second half, as it adds little value to the story. Priya Bhavani Shankar delivers a decent performance as the district collector, but her flashback portions with Gautham Karthik could have been more impactful.<br /><br />The intense performances of Silambarasan and Gautham Karthik make us overlook some of the logical mistakes made by the writer. Gautham, in particular, manages to look authentic as an undercover cop. Gautham Vasudev Menon's performance as the Deputy Chief Minister is commendable, and the technical aspects of the film are quite efficient, with only a couple of shots falling out of focus.<br /><br />Overall, Pathu Thala may not be a great film for those who have watched the original, but it's still worth watching for the lead actors and some standout moments.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

It&rsquo;s a hopeful celebration of found family and a reminder that life ebbs and flows, so other family-centric dramas that extract extraordinary meaning from everyday moments &mdash; like&nbsp;This Is Us,&nbsp;Parenthood,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Friday Night Lights&nbsp;&mdash; come to mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Take:</strong>&nbsp;Before&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things&nbsp;</em>drops its title card in the Season 5 premiere, you&rsquo;ll be wiping tears from your eyes and feeling as though you just reunited with a long-lost friend. Without spoiling the series&rsquo; highly-anticipated return, &ldquo;The Last Dance&rdquo; maximizes the storytelling potential of the show&rsquo;s final 13 episodes by succinctly addressing Season 4 cliffhangers and swiftly laying groundwork for future plot points.</p>\n<p>In true&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things</em>&nbsp;fashion, the premiere finds characters overflowing with formative memories, sparked by anything from a stick of deodorant to a box of Good &amp; Plenty. Several head-scratching moments pop up throughout the hour &mdash; including a major plot twist and an early line from Eddie that made me cringe so hard I questioned his entire personality. But as usual, the series&rsquo; lovable characters, aspirational connections, and relatable struggles help quell your doubts. Five seasons in, the cast&rsquo;s chemistry has never been stronger, nor has character growth ever been so apparent. James Roday Rodriguez continues to effortlessly tap into the duality of Gary Mendez, and the premiere&rsquo;s fluctuating tone and moving monologues tease marvelously multi-faceted performances to come.</p>\n<figure><img sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024 1024w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1284 1284w\" alt=\"LIZZY GREENE SORTING WHITE AND PINK GOOD &amp; PLENTY CANDY ON 'A MILLION LITTLE THINGS'\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-srcset=\"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300 300w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024 1024w, https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-amlt.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1284 1284w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\n<figcaption data-gramm=\"false\">Photo: ABC/Sergei Bachlakov</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Through life events as monumental as a funeral or as inconsequential as a trip to the store, the drama continues to convey the importance of showing up for one other, being open to humor in times of grief, and remembering that tomorrow is unpromised. From&nbsp;abortion&nbsp;and racism to mental health, LGBTQ+ stories, addiction, and more, the series has never shied away from addressing serious topics in a prime-time ABC slot, and the premiere offers touching reassurance that same candor will continue to the end.</p>\n<p>As is often the case with shows that strike a balance between remarkably human and deliciously cheesy storytelling, the beginning of&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things</em>&lsquo; end will leave you feeling reinvigorated, raring to reclaim your time, and hungry for heart-to-hearts. Faithful viewers know that Gary and friends have &mdash; let&rsquo;s not sugarcoat it &mdash; been through&nbsp;<em>a lot of shit&nbsp;</em>since 2018. The series has always captured the confusing reality that life is beautiful and relentless. The highs demand to be celebrated, in part, because the lows never let up. But the lows aren&rsquo;t as bad if you have a solid support system behind you, and these tight-knit Bruins fans and their families are solid as they come. A mix of new beginnings and challenges are foreshadowed at the start of Season 5, but here&rsquo;s hoping that this group can finally catch one single collective break when the end credits roll on the series finale.</p>\n<p><strong>Sex and Skin:&nbsp;</strong>Aside from a few smooches,&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things</em>&nbsp;keeps its farewell season premiere clean. The only stripping down these characters do at the start of Season 5 is internal, because in true&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things&nbsp;</em>fashion, everyone is bravely baring their emotions.</p>\n<p><strong>Parting Shot:&nbsp;</strong>The episode highlights moments of pain and loss, but the parting shot captures the show&rsquo;s fictional friend group-turned-family celebrating a rare moment of unbridled joy. It&rsquo;s about time!</p>\n<p><strong>Sleeper Star:&nbsp;</strong>We got a taste of the full spectrum of emotions James Roday Rodriguez and Allison Miller will cycle through before saying goodbye to Gary and Maggie. But two unexpected season premiere standouts were Lou Beatty Jr. as Rome&rsquo;s dad Walter Howard, and his girlfriend Florence, played by Karen Robinson.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Pilot-y Line:</strong>&nbsp;Towards the end of the episode a character says, &ldquo;Sorry about bringing an entourage&hellip;it&rsquo;s just that our friend group, we&rsquo;re very invested in each other&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo; A real&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things&nbsp;</em>evergreen statement.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Call:&nbsp;</strong>STREAM IT. If you&rsquo;ve been following this friend group for four seasons, then you, too, are very invested in their lives.&nbsp;<em>A Million Little Things</em>&nbsp;stays true to itself in the Season 5 premiere, so if you enjoyed the ride so far and want to see where these characters&rsquo; stories end, streaming the season is a no-brainer.</p>"
